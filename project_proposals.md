## Project 1: Group Effects

### Background

When AIM was still a thing, even now, I'd notice that if someone was having a bad day and needed to vent, many people would have similarly bad days, and would vent, nearly at the same time. This was many years back, though I have noticed similar effects around me today.

Last week, on Friday, December 2, 2016 - many colleagues and friends expressed they were happy that the week was over (it was a slog). Even my mentor, Ryan, mentioned as much. In the evening, on Instagram, at least 2 posts (I have few in my feed) had posts referencing the rough week past, and looking forward to resetting over the weekend. This is what led to Group Effects as a potential project.
